# Temperature Sensor

Example model no.: `TMP36` (analog sensor)

PINs:
- VCC
- OUT
- GND

1-wire sensors:

- DS1820
- LM75

platin sensors (Pt100 sensors): use platin and can sense temperatures between -100 and 300 degrees celsius

Also refer to air moisture sensors for `DHT11` and `DHT22` (which measure aire moisture as well as temperature).

Example for air pressure and temperature sensor: `BMP180` (former `BMP085`).
